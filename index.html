      <h3>What is cupcake?</h3>
      <p>
        Cupcake.css is a classless CSS framework to sweeten up your html pages
        and gives you the possibility to create stylish websites by writing HTML
        code only. The magic comes from a single CSS file which apply styles to
        all common (and some rare) web elements: sorted, categorizes and
        themeable! Therefore you can focus on writing your content and worry
        less about frameworks, libraries and design systems. The idea behind
        cupcake.css is to support humans that like to work in an dependency free
        enviroment, for example with basic HTML and CSS.
      </p>

        HTML. In any way you will have the power over your semantic HTML back
        again! The foundations of the web are semantic - cupcake.css makes then
