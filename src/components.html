<p>One morning, when <mark>Gregor Samsa</mark> woke from <code>&#x3C;troubled dreams&#x3E;</code>, he found himself <strong>transformed</strong> in his bed into a <em>horrible vermin</em>. He lay on his <u>armour-like</u> back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and <a href="#">divided by arches</a> into stiff sections while he was pressing <kbd>ALT + F4</kbd>. The bedding was <s>easily</s> hardly able to cover it and seemed <abbr>ready to slide</abbr> off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.</p>
