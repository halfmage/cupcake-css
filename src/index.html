<h2 id="usage">Structure and usage</h2>

<p>You can use any HTML page structure you would like but cupcake css works the best if you will keep a few simple points into mind. After the opening <code>&#x3C;body&#x3E;</code> tag you have a couple of choices. The first header element will stretch over the entire website and is the place to put your website title and your website navigation elements. After that you can create a cool hero component by using a <code>&#x3C;section&#x3E;</code> block directly after the header. Follwing this it's best to put your website content into the <code>&#x3C;main&#x3E;</code> element, because this will give you some options if the content should be wrapped or stretch over the whole screen like the header.</p>
